# Description
   I'm layed back but know when to kick into gear, I work well in teams and underpressure. I'm hard working and even manged to work my way off of an IEP in school,    I was told that I'd always would be on it with 0 hopes of being able to be on the same level as my peers. I'm very dedicated and masterful on what I do after       the large learning curve. I'd say my weaknesses are the fact it takes a little longer to pick up systems and skills but once I get them I improve and master        them super quickly. And my last one is my spelling. Thank you for reading!
